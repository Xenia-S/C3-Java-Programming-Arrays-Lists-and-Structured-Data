You will start with the Caesar Cipher algorithm you learned about in the videos, and you will make some enhancements to it, so that it works with all letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and to make it a little bit harder to decrypt. Write these methods in a CaesarCipher class you can use in the next lesson.

Write the void method testCaesar that has no parameters. This method should read a file and encrypt the complete file using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, printing the encrypted message. You may want to include the lines.

Modify the encrypt method to be able to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, encrypt("First Legion", 23) should return “Cfopq Ibdflk”, and encrypt(“First Legion”, 17) should return “Wzijk Cvxzfe”. Be sure to test the encrypt method.
