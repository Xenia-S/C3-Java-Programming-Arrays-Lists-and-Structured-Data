# [Java Programming Arrays Lists and Structured Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data)

This course is offered at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and is a third course of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

In this course I used a custom Bluej Development Environment designed by educators at the University of Kent. You can get the IDE from the [Duke University website](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).

I finished the course on June 23, 2022, here's the [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/023f89ad31ec8430e0ef9c0fb9019afa).

### What I learned in this course:
1. Read and write data from/to files;
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
